# Learning a Refinement Modle for Variant Analysis in Non-Human Primate Genomes

This repository contains the source code used to train and evaluate the genome variant refinement model proposed in the paper:  
**"Learning a Refinement Model for Variant Analysis in Non-Human Primate Genomes"**

It supports model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using both human and non-human primate genome datasets.
